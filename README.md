Friend Management: Users can add friends, search for other users, and view friend lists.
Top Contributors: The platform showcases the top 10 users based on their contributions - calculated by the sum of uploaded photos and comments.
Authentication: Supports secure user login and logout.
2. Album & Photo Management:
Browsing: Allows users to browse through all public photos & albums, or specifically view their own.
