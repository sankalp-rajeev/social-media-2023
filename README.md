- **Friend Management**: Abilities include adding friends, searching for users, and viewing friend lists.
- **Top Contributors**: The platform highlights the top 10 contributors based on their sum of uploaded photos and comments.
- **Authentication**: Features secure user login/logout processes.

### 2. **Album & Photo Management**:
- **Browsing**: Users can peruse all public photos & albums or just their own.
- **Creation & Deletion**: Once registered, users can initiate albums, upload photos, and opt to delete them. Deleting an album with content removes its photos. Only the rightful owner can modify or erase albums/photos.

### 4. **Comments & Likes**:
- **Engagement**: Users can engage by commenting and "liking" photos. These metrics contribute to a user's overall activity score.
- **Search Comments**: This feature lets users search based on comments. Results display users who have matched the query in their comments, organized by frequency.

### 5. **Recommendations**:
- **Friend Suggestions**: Uses the 'friends-of-friends' approach to recommend potential friends to users.
- **Photo Recommendations**: The system suggests photos based on a user's tags. Recommendations are derived from tag matches and the total tag count.
